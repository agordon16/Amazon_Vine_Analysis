## Summary
While there is a substantial disparity in the *total* number of Vine reveiws versus non-Vine reviews, based on the percentages of 5-star ratings, there does not appear to be a bias towards positivity on the Vine review side. Both Vine and non-Vine reviewers giving a 5-star rating are between 50-60% which could lead one to surmise that the products are equally reviewed.

An additional analysis to support or negate this finding would be to calculate percentages of 1-star reviews instead. Incorporating additional filters such as verified purchases could also paint a more accurate picture of the validity of both types of reviews.
